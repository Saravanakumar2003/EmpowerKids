# Empowerkids Complaint Portal

## About the Project
I created the Empowerkids Complaint Portal to empower children and give them a voice. As advocates for children's rights and wellbeing, I disheartened to see many instances where children's concerns went unheard or were dismissed due to their young age and lack of resources. So, I envisioned a platform that would provide them an avenue to speak up.

The portal provides a safe, supportive and non-judgmental space for children to voice their grievances. Whether it is an issue at school, home or in their community, children can file complaints through the portal to bring it to light. Filing the complaint itself can be an act of catharsis and comfort for the child.

## How It Will Help Children:

- Gives them an avenue to voice grievances affecting them
- Experts will listen, support them and stand up for them
- Complaints will be escalated to higher authorities if unresolved
- Raises awareness on issues disproportionately affecting kids
- Drives better policies and social change to protect children
- Helps those facing unjust situations and unable to speak up
- Supports vulnerable children so they don't feel alone
- Empowers children by amplifying their voices for good

# Technical Details

## Front-end
The front-end of this platform is built using **React.js** in conjunction with **Material UI** to ensure a modern and intuitive user interface.

## Back-end
I have leveraged **Firebase** to create a robust back-end infrastructure. Google **Firestore** serves as the database, offering a flexible foundation for future expansions and easy addition of new agents or functionalities.

## Hosting
The platform is hosted on **Netlify**, a powerful cloud platform that facilitates seamless deployment, instant scaling, and hassle-free hosting without the need for constant supervision.
